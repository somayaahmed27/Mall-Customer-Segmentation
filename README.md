#Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

Overview:
This project explores customer segmentation for a mall using K-Means clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Customer segmentation involves grouping similar customers together based on certain characteristics, allowing businesses to tailor marketing strategies and enhance customer experience.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains information about mall customers, including features such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score. The goal is to uncover patterns in customer behavior and preferences.

Methodology:
The K-Means clustering algorithm is employed to partition customers into distinct segments based on their similarities. The algorithm iteratively assigns customers to clusters and updates cluster centroids to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares. The optimal number of clusters is determined through techniques like the elbow method.

Files:
1.	customer_segmentation.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, and K-Means clustering.
2.	Mall_Customers.csv: CSV file containing the raw customer data.
3.	README.md: Detailed documentation and instructions for running the code.

Results:
The results of the clustering analysis are visualized using charts and graphs, providing insights into the characteristics of each customer segment. These insights can guide marketing strategies, product recommendations, and personalized services.
